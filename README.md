Supermarket Sales Data Analysis with Power BI

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of supermarket sales data using Power BI to uncover key insights and trends. The analysis involved:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Imported raw sales data into Power BI, performed data cleaning, and transformed the dataset for accurate analysis.
Interactive Dashboards: Designed and developed interactive dashboards that visually represent sales performance, customer demographics, and product category trends.
Sales Performance Analysis: Analyzed sales metrics such as total revenue, profit margins, and sales growth across different time periods and regions.
Customer Behavior Insights: Explored customer purchasing patterns and preferences, identifying top-selling products and peak shopping times
